# Character Level Language Modeling using RNN
The dataset includes dinosaur names. The goal is to train a recurrent neural network. This is done to build a character level language model that can be used to develop and sample new dinosaur names.
It also uses gradient clipping and concept of sampling.
(This mini-project is a part of Deep Learning specialization course. The dataset, any pre-trained weights/models and Model Architecture used were provided by Coursera.)
