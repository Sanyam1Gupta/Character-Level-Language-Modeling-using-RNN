# Character Level Language Modeling using RNN
The dataset includes dinosaur names. The goal is to train a recurrent neural network. This is done to build a character level language model that can be used to develop and sample new dinosaur names.
It also uses gradient clipping and concept of sampling.
(This mini-project is a part of Machine Learning specialization course, dataset or any pre-trained weights/models used were provided by Coursera.)
